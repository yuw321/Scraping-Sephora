A deep cleaning, pre-shave cleanser and scrub in one.

What it is formulated to do:
This scrub clears the way for an easier, closer shave by smoothing the surface of the skin and clearing congested pores. Menthol and vitamin C help wake-up and invigorate skin while small, highly uniform scrubbing particles open congested pores and sweep away deep-down oil, dirt and dead skin cells. Why bother? Because removing oil, dirt and dead cells helps the razor get closer to the skin for a smoother, easier shave. Getting rid of those dead cells also helps prevent in-grown hairs.


Regular exfoliation (gently scrubbing off old skin cells) also improves skin's appearance and radiance by exposing newer, younger cells beneath the surface.

Almonds are an incredibly delicate fruit to grow: the best almonds require cool air without ever freezing. L'Occitane almonds are sourced from a very special region in Haute Provence, where giant windmills circulate air to create an environment for some of the most delicious and nutritious almonds to grow. L'Occitane supports the sustainability of almond trees in the region, as these trees—while difficult to grow—are a staple to the beauty of the Provencal landscape.
